# Development guide

Contributor-focused workflows: local setup details stay in [SETUP.md](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/SETUP.md) at the repo root (Windows, troubleshooting, MCP/OpenClaw).

## Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre.git
cd opensre
make install
```

[`make install`](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/Makefile) runs `uv sync --frozen --extra dev` and the analytics install helper. Use **`uv run opensre …`** from the repo root so you always hit this checkout’s `.venv`, not another `opensre` on your `PATH`.

```bash
opensre onboard
opensre investigate -i tests/e2e/kubernetes/fixtures/datadog_k8s_alert.json
```

## Quality gates (same as CI)

From the repo root:

```bash
make lint          # ruff check
make format-check  # ruff format --check (CI-enforced)
make typecheck     # mypy app/
make test-cov      # pytest + coverage (default unit suite)
```

One-shot (includes heavier `test-full`): `make check`.

Before a PR, run at least `make lint`, `make format-check`, `make typecheck`, and `make test-cov` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Routing policy architecture

Routing precedence, postprocessing transforms, compatibility seams, and the rule-extension checklist are documented in [`docs/routing-policy-architecture.md`](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/docs/routing-policy-architecture.md).

## Investigation tool calling

Tool schemas, provider adapters (`agent_llm_client.py`), and investigation message shapes are documented in [`docs/investigation-tool-calling.md`](investigation-tool-calling.md) (all LLM providers, not vendor-specific).

## Interactive shell: REPL watchdog demo

PR reviewers expect a **visible demo** (terminal log or screenshot) in the PR under **Demo/Screenshot**, not only tests. Copy the exact steps from this section into your PR description, then attach your terminal output or recording.

1. `uv run opensre` (TTY).
2. `/trust on` (or confirm the elevated-action prompt when running `/watch`).
3. `/watch <pid> --max-cpu 80` — expect `task … started.` (use a real PID, e.g. the shell’s Python process).
4. `/watches` — table columns include id, pid, kind, status, thresholds, last sample.
5. `/unwatch <task_id>` or `/cancel <task_id>` — then `/watches` again; status should show **cancelled**.
6. Optional: lower `--max-cpu` so a threshold trips; after Telegram sends, the REPL prints one line: `[task …] alarm fired: … (telegram delivered)`.

Automated equivalent (runs in `make test-cov`):  
`uv run pytest tests/cli/interactive_shell/test_watchdog_repl_e2e_demo.py -v --tb=short`

Longer transcript (optional): [tests/cli/interactive_shell/repl_watchdog_demo.md](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/tests/cli/interactive_shell/repl_watchdog_demo.md).

## VS Code dev container

The dev container is defined under [`.devcontainer/`](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/tree/main/.devcontainer). It builds from [`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) (Python **3.13**), then **`postCreateCommand`** creates `.venv-devcontainer` and runs **`pip install -e '.[dev]'`** (not `uv`). Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Colima, or another compatible runtime must be available on the host.

## Benchmark

```bash
make benchmark
```

To refresh README benchmark copy from cached results (no LLM calls): `make benchmark-update-readme`.

## Deployment

### Hosted runtime

1. Deploy this repository as a standard Python/FastAPI app using the repo `Dockerfile` or your host's native Python workflow.
2. Set `LLM_PROVIDER` and the matching API key (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` — see [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/blob/main/.env.example)).
3. Add integration and storage env vars your deployment needs.

Minimal LLM env:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

### Railway (self-hosted alternative)

Ensure the Railway project has Postgres and Redis and that the OpenSRE service has **`DATABASE_URI`** and **`REDIS_URI`** wired to them before deploying.

Deploy the service using your Railway project workflow (see [deployment.mdx](deployment.mdx)).

After deploy, register the remote agent:

```bash
opensre remote --url https://<your-service>.up.railway.app health
```

If the service never becomes healthy, confirm both `DATABASE_URI` and `REDIS_URI` are set on the service.

### Remote hosted ops (Railway)

After deploy:

```bash
opensre remote ops --provider railway --project <project> --service <service> status
opensre remote ops --provider railway --project <project> --service <service> logs --lines 200
opensre remote ops --provider railway --project <project> --service <service> logs --follow
opensre remote ops --provider railway --project <project> --service <service> restart --yes
```

OpenSRE remembers the last `provider`, so you can shorten to:

```bash
opensre remote ops status
opensre remote ops logs --follow
```

## Telemetry and privacy

`opensre` ships with two telemetry stacks, both opt-out:

- **PostHog** — anonymous product analytics (commands used, success/failure, rough runtime, CLI/Python/OS/arch, and limited command metadata).
- **Sentry** — crashes and errors (stack traces, environment, release).

Events are tagged with `entrypoint`, `opensre.runtime`, and `deployment_method`. Sensitive headers, paths, and secret-shaped keys are scrubbed before send.

A random install ID is stored under `~/.opensre/anonymous_id`. PostHog `distinct_id` is scoped to that ID. Telemetry is off in GitHub Actions and pytest.

### First-launch GitHub login

On the first interactive launch (all platforms, except CI/CD and test harnesses), OpenSRE requires a GitHub device-flow sign-in before the REPL prompt. On success it sets `github_username` as a PostHog **person property** (via `$identify`/`$set`, which forces `$process_person_profile: True` for that one event — this is the only intentional PII OpenSRE sends) and emits a `github_login_completed` event. A configured GitHub integration suppresses re-prompting on later launches.

The existing kill-switches still apply: `OPENSRE_NO_TELEMETRY` / `DO_NOT_TRACK` make the `$identify` and `github_login_completed` calls no-ops, but the login itself still runs. Set `OPENSRE_SKIP_GITHUB_LOGIN=1` to bypass the login gate entirely (also auto-bypassed in CI — `CI=true`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` — and in pytest).

### Kill-switch matrix

| Env var                        | PostHog    | Sentry     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| `OPENSRE_NO_TELEMETRY=1`       | disabled   | disabled   |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`               | disabled   | disabled   |
| `OPENSRE_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1` | disabled   | unaffected |
| `OPENSRE_SENTRY_DISABLED=1`    | unaffected | disabled   |
| `OPENSRE_SENTRY_LOGGING_DISABLED=1` | unaffected | disables `logger.error`/`logger.exception` forwarding to Sentry; `capture_exception` unaffected |

Full opt-out:

```bash
export OPENSRE_NO_TELEMETRY=1
```

### Sentry DSN

Self-hosted users can set `SENTRY_DSN` to their project; unset uses the bundled default. `SENTRY_DSN=` (empty) drops events in `before_send`.

### Deployment tagging

Set `OPENSRE_DEPLOYMENT_METHOD` to `railway`, `ec2`, `vercel`, or `local` (default `local`) to label Sentry events.

### Local PostHog event log

By default, outbound PostHog payloads are also appended to `~/.opensre/posthog_events.txt` (rotates at 1000 lines). Disable:

```bash
export OPENSRE_ANALYTICS_LOG_EVENTS=0
```

We do not collect alert contents, file contents, hostnames, credentials, raw CLI arguments, or PII by design.
