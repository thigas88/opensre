## Tracer Development Reference

## Build and Run commands

- Build `make install` (sets up the project environment via `uv sync` and installs this repo in editable mode)
- Run **`uv run opensre …`** from the repo root while developing — preferred approach, uses this checkout even if another `opensre` is on your `PATH`.
- Use **`uv run python …`** for any Python commands.

## Code Style

- Use strict typing, follow DRY principle
- One clear purpose per file (separation of concerns)
- Do not keep compatibility-only forwarding modules after refactors. Once imports and tests
  are migrated, remove the old module path in the same change and use one canonical import path.

Before any push or PR creation follow **[CI.md](CI.md)** — lint, format, typecheck, and test commands all live there.

## 2. Entry Points

### Adding a Tool

The tool registry auto-discovers modules under `tools/`, so the normal path is to add one module or package there and let discovery pick it up.

Files to touch:

- `integrations/<vendor>/tools/<tool_name>_tool/__init__.py` when the tool belongs to an existing vendor integration (most common path).
- `tools/system/<ToolName>/__init__.py` or `tools/cross_vendor/<ToolName>/__init__.py` only when the tool is not vendor-specific — see [docs/tool-placement-policy.md](docs/tool-placement-policy.md) for the system vs. cross_vendor decision rule (e.g. `tools/system/sre_guidance_tool/`).
- `core/tool_framework/utils/` if the tool needs shared helper code reused across vendors.
- `integrations/<name>/client.py` if the tool should reuse a dedicated integration API client instead of inlining requests.
- `docs/<tool_name>.mdx` for user-facing usage, parameters, and examples.
- `docs/docs.json` — add the page path (without `.mdx`) to the appropriate `pages` array so Mintlify navigation includes it.
- `tests/tools/test_<tool_name>.py` for behavior and regression coverage.

Steps:

1. Pick the simplest shape that fits the tool. Use a `BaseTool` subclass (from `core.tool_framework.base`) for richer behavior; use `@tool(...)` from `core.tool_framework.tool_decorator` for a lightweight function tool.
2. Declare clear metadata: `name`, `description`, `source`, `input_schema`, and any `use_cases`, `requires`, `outputs`, or `retrieval_controls` you need.
3. Treat tool packages as production code, not registry placeholders. A tool package may not be an empty or nearly-empty `__init__.py` whose only purpose is discovery. Directionally, non-trivial tools should use focused sibling modules such as `tool.py`, `client.py`/`delivery.py`, `validation.py`, `models.py`, or `results.py`; `__init__.py` should usually be a small registry entrypoint that imports the public tool object.
4. Keep separation of concerns. Put reusable transport or integration-specific parsing code in `integrations/<name>/` or shared tool glue in `core/tool_framework/utils/` rather than copying it into the tool body. Split validation, credential/parameter resolution, dispatch/client calls, result normalization, and error handling into focused helpers or sibling files instead of tangling them inside `run()`.
5. Return stable, planner-friendly results. Expected failures should produce a structured error shape; external side effects must declare `side_effect_level`, require approval when appropriate, and avoid leaking secrets through `extract_params`, return values, logs, or traceable tool-call kwargs.
6. If the tool should appear in both investigation and chat surfaces, set `surfaces=("investigation", "chat")`.
7. Add tests that cover schema shape, availability, extraction, success, failure, and the runtime behavior that the planner depends on.
8. Before opening or approving the PR, follow [TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) for tool/integration-specific wiring, payload, docs, and regression checks.

### Changing the investigation pipeline

Investigations are coordinated in `tools/investigation/lifecycle.py` and exposed via
`tools/investigation/capability.py`. Semantic stages live under
`tools/investigation/stages/`; reporting lives under
`tools/investigation/reporting/`. See
[docs/investigation-pipeline-architecture.md](docs/investigation-pipeline-architecture.md)
for the end-to-end stage/loop diagrams before making structural changes.

Files to touch:

- `tools/investigation/lifecycle.py` for high-level stage ordering.
- `core/state/` for shared agent state and investigation pipeline slice contracts
  that cross stage boundaries.
- `core/domain/` for pure investigation rules (alert source mapping, tool planning,
  category alignment, correlation scoring).
- `core/` for shared LLM runtime helpers (tool loop and LLM invoke error
  classification).
- `core/state/*.py` when adding or renaming persisted investigation fields
  (update `AgentStateModel` and the matching slice).
- `docs/` — update or add a page if the change introduces user-visible behavior or configuration.
- `tests/` coverage for the affected CLI, synthetic, or integration paths.

Steps:

1. Keep each stage focused on one responsibility.
2. Extend state models when new fields cross stage boundaries.
3. Update tests that exercise `run_investigation` / streaming entry points.

### Adding an Integration

Integration work usually spans config normalization, verification, integration-local clients/helpers, tools, docs, and tests.

Files to touch:

- `integrations/<name>/__init__.py` for config builders, validators, selectors, and normalization helpers.
- `integrations/<name>/client.py` when the integration needs a dedicated API client.
- `integrations/<name>/verifier.py` when the integration needs local verification logic.
- `integrations/catalog.py` when the new integration must be resolved into the shared runtime config.
- `integrations/verify.py` when the integration needs a local verification path.
- `tools/<Name>Tool/` or `tools/<tool_file>.py` for the user-facing tool layer, or
  `integrations/<name>/tools/` when consolidating a vendor's tools under its integration package.
- `docs/<name>.mdx` for user-facing setup, usage, and verification docs.
- `docs/docs.json` — add the page path (without `.mdx`) to the appropriate `pages` array so Mintlify navigation includes it.
- `tests/integrations/test_<name>.py` for config, verification, and store coverage.
- `tests/tools/test_<tool_name>.py` and any relevant `tests/e2e/` or `tests/synthetic/` files if the integration is exercised by tools or scenarios.

Treat `integrations/` as the canonical user/config and external-client boundary, and `tools/` as the canonical agent-callable boundary. Do not add or import top-level `vendors/` or `services/` packages.

Examples from the repo:

- Datadog: `integrations/datadog/` (including `integrations/datadog/tools/` for query tools), `integrations/catalog.py`, and Datadog-related tests under `tests/integrations/datadog/` and `tests/tools/test_datadog_*.py`.
- Grafana: `integrations/grafana/` (including `integrations/grafana/tools/` for query tools), `integrations/catalog.py`, `surfaces/cli/wizard/local_grafana_stack/`, and Grafana-related tests under `tests/integrations/grafana/` and `tests/tools/test_grafana_*.py`.
- Hermes: `integrations/hermes/`, `tools/HermesLogsTool/`, `tools/HermesSessionEvidenceTool/`, `surfaces/cli/commands/hermes.py`, `tests/hermes/`, and `tests/synthetic/hermes/`.

Basic steps:

1. Add the integration config and normalization logic first so the rest of the stack can consume a consistent shape.
2. Add or update the integration-local client only when the integration needs direct remote calls.
3. Wire the tool layer after the config path is stable.
4. Add docs and tests together so the integration is understandable and verifiable.
5. Run `make verify-integrations` before treating the integration as complete.
6. Before opening or approving the PR, follow [TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) for integration completeness, investigation wiring, docs, and demo/test requirements.

### Large multi-surface refactors

A consolidation refactor collapses behavior that has diverged across
multiple surfaces (`interactive_shell/`, `gateway/`, `tools/investigation/`,
`core/agent_harness/`, etc.) into one shared class or module — e.g. the
`agent_harness` T-2/T-3 series (session management, integration resolution,
startup consolidation). These are higher-risk than a normal feature or tool
change: they touch several call sites at once and the source issue's file
paths tend to be stale by the time work starts.

Before starting this class of work, follow
[REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md](REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md) — it covers dependency
ordering, re-validating the issue against current repo state, incremental
per-surface migration, and the import-boundary tests that must keep
enforcing the new pattern.

## 3. Rules (if X -> do Y)

- If core agent or pipeline logic changes -> run `make test-cov` and `make typecheck`.
- If a change consolidates or re-homes behavior across multiple surfaces (a "refactor" issue, not a localized fix) -> follow [REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md](REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md) before writing code and before opening the PR.
- If a new feature is shipped (tool, CLI command, pipeline behavior, integration) -> add a `docs/` page or section covering usage, configuration, and examples before the PR is opened.
- If a new `docs/` page is added or renamed -> register it in `docs/docs.json` under the correct `pages` array in the same PR (path without `.mdx`, e.g. `messaging/whatsapp` for `docs/messaging/whatsapp.mdx`).
- If an existing feature changes behavior, flags, or config shape -> update the relevant `docs/` page in the same PR; docs and code must stay in sync.
- When writing or editing a `docs/` page -> write for **users, not contributors**. Open with a command quick-reference table (command | what it does) if the page covers CLI commands. Follow with brief practical examples. Keep internal file formats, JSONL schemas, and implementation details out of user-facing pages — move those to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` or a contributor-only reference file if truly needed.
- If a tool's API or schema changes -> update docs in `docs/` and update the related unit tests, usually under `tests/tools/`. For investigation LLM tool-calling (any provider), follow [docs/investigation-tool-calling.md](docs/investigation-tool-calling.md).
- If adding or materially changing a tool/integration -> follow [TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) in the same PR.
- If an integration changes -> update `tests/integrations/` and verify with `make verify-integrations`.
- If adding a new integration -> follow [TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) before opening the PR for review.
- If adding new tests -> place them in `tests/`, never inside the source packages (no inline tests), except gateway tests which intentionally live in `gateway/tests/` per `gateway/AGENTS.md`.
- If CI-only tests are added -> mark them with the right pytest marker or place them in the appropriate e2e/synthetic/chaos folder so they do not run in the default local suite.
- If investigation branching or loop behavior changes -> update `tools/investigation/lifecycle.py` and the tests for that path.
- If adding or changing interactive REPL behavior (slash commands, session management, display output) -> use `ReplDriver` from `tests/utils/repl_driver.py` for live verification alongside unit tests; see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
- If pushing or creating a PR -> follow the full pre-push checklist in [CI.md](CI.md).

## 4. Testing

Test commands, turn-handling rules, CI-only paths: **[CI.md](CI.md)**. Live REPL testing with `ReplDriver`: **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)**.

## 5. Footguns (common mistakes to avoid)

- No planning-stage fail-closed safeguard (v0.1): the interactive-shell action planner never denies a turn with "I couldn't safely decide actions". All terminal actions are read-only, so unmatched/ambiguous/chatty clauses run what they can and fall through to the assistant. Do **not** reintroduce a planner denial, the `mark_unhandled` tool, or the `UNHANDLED:` convention. Rationale and details: `core/agent_harness/AGENTS.md` and `docs/interactive-shell-action-policy.md`. If mutating actions are ever added, gate them at the execution stage (`tools/interactive_shell/shared/execution_policy.py`), not the planner.
- Vendored deps: No obvious vendored third-party dependencies are present. Python dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`, and the docs site has its own `docs/package.json` and `docs/pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not vendor new libraries unless there is a strong reason.
- Secrets: Never commit `.env` - always use `.env.example` as the template. Use read-only credentials for production integrations.
- CI-only tests: Some e2e tests, including Kubernetes, EKS, and chaos engineering paths, require live infrastructure and are excluded from `make test-cov`. Do not expect them to pass locally without that environment.
- Legacy graph dev server: removed; use `make dev` for a local uvicorn hint or run investigations via the CLI.
- Docker requirement: Several targets, including the Grafana local stack and Chaos Mesh workflows, require a running Docker daemon.
- Docs navigation: Adding an `.mdx` file under `docs/` is not enough — Mintlify only shows pages listed in `docs/docs.json`. Forgetting the `pages` entry leaves the doc unreachable from the site sidebar.
- Investigation tool schemas: draft-07 JSON Schema (e.g. `"type": ["object", "null"]`) can pass loose checks but fail the LLM API on first invoke because **all** available investigation tools are sent together. Normalize in the provider adapter and extend registry contract tests; see [docs/investigation-tool-calling.md](docs/investigation-tool-calling.md).
- External-system code: `integrations/` owns config, clients, verifiers, and integration-local helpers; `tools/` owns every `@tool(...)` function and `BaseTool` class. Do not reintroduce top-level `vendors/` or `services/` packages.
- Compatibility shims: Do not leave modules whose only job is to re-export symbols from a new
  location. Update callers to the canonical module and delete the old path.
- Empty or monolithic tool packages: Do not add a `tools/<name>/__init__.py`
  that exists only to make discovery pass, and do not hide a non-trivial tool
  implementation entirely in `__init__.py`. Use sibling modules for validation,
  models, delivery/client calls, result shaping, and error handling whenever the
  tool is more than a small function. Every tool must meet the implementation
  and quality standards in the Adding a Tool section and
  [TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](TOOL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md).
- Interactive-shell action selection: do not implement regex/keyword/fuzzy
  intent routing, literal slash-command shortcuts, or deterministic action
  bypasses around the action-agent AgentTool path. Engineers have been fired
  before for implementing this exact shortcut. The runtime's literal-`/slash`
  detection (`input_policy._literal_slash_command_text`) is terminal UI policy
  only (spinner/stdin gating), not an execution path.
