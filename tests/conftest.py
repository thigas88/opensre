    Some app code mutates the live process environment as a side effect — most
    notably ``sync_provider_env``, which calls ``os.environ.pop``/``update`` to
    drop stale provider keys (including other providers' API keys such as
    ``OPENAI_API_KEY``) when switching the active LLM provider. Tests that
    exercise those paths (the onboarding wizard, provider switching, etc.) do
    not ``monkeypatch`` every key the code touches, so without this snapshot the
    mutations leak across tests sharing an xdist worker. The leaked deletion of
    ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` made later ``live_llm`` planner contracts resolve the
    fallback (credit-exhausted anthropic) provider and skip. Restoring the full
    environment after each test contains that whole class of leakage.

    Module-/session-scoped fixtures still work: their env mutations happen
    before this function-scoped snapshot is taken on the first test and are
    never removed, so the snapshot carries them forward.
