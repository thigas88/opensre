"""Tests for the evidence-weighted top-3 re-ranker (Lever D).

11:46 failure analysis showed 53% of failures had the correct fault_object
SOMEWHERE in top-3 but only 38% at rank-1 — 15 points of object accuracy
sitting in ranks 2-3 because the LLM's confidence ordering didn't put the
best-evidenced candidate first. The re-ranker resolves this by scoring
each prediction against the actual investigation evidence and reordering
DESC by citation count, stable on ties.

These tests pin the contract:

  - identity on degenerate inputs (≤1 pred, blank evidence, all-tied scores)
  - rank-2 with more evidence-substring hits gets promoted to rank-1
  - the ``rank`` field on each dict is rewritten so position and rank agree
  - structural stop-words (`service`, `app`, etc.) are NOT counted —
    otherwise every K8s diagnosis ties at the same noise floor
  - input list is NEVER mutated (returns a new list)
