"""OpenAI structured-outputs variant of the predictor.

Targets the residual predictor drift (OBJECT_HIT_RC_MISS) measured at 24%
of Runtime losses + 8.8% of all opensre+llm cells on the post-vocab-fix
baseline. The mechanism is API-layer schema enforcement: the LLM literally
cannot emit out-of-enum tokens for ``root_cause`` and ``fault_taxonomy``.

Multi-provider plan (this file = the OpenAI implementation):
  - **OpenAI** (this module): ``client.beta.chat.completions.parse()`` with
    a Pydantic schema whose Literal enums come from ``vocabulary.py``.
    Requires ``gpt-4o-2024-08-06+`` or ``gpt-5``.
  - **Anthropic** (planned, ``llm_call_structured_anthropic.py``):
    tool-use with ``input_schema`` enums + ``tool_choice: {type: "tool",
    name: "..."}`` to force structured emit. Works on Claude 3+ models.
  - **DeepSeek** (planned, ``llm_call_structured_deepseek.py``):
    OpenAI-compatible ``response_format`` — likely a thin wrapper around
    the OpenAI client pointed at DeepSeek's base URL.

The mechanism is the same across providers (grammar-constrained sampling);
the API shapes differ. The dispatcher in ``adapter.py`` routes to the
correct per-provider variant based on the configured LLM.

Anti-overfit discipline:
  - The Pydantic schema's enum surfaces are built **programmatically** from
    ``vocabulary.py`` — same source of truth the scorer's enums and the
    text predictor's system prompt read from. There is no place in this
    module to silently add a corpus-specific token; any addition has to
    land in ``vocabulary.py`` where the scorer also sees it.
  - The system + user prompts are reused verbatim from the text predictor.
    No prompt-side signal is added that names corpus services or fault
    patterns. The lift, if any, comes from grammar-constrained sampling
    alone — not from learning the corpus.
  - ``fault_object`` is kept as ``str`` (not Literal). It would be
    over-constrained to enumerate every known service/node/namespace
    because the scorer accepts open ``namespace_<reason>`` tokens and we
    want the schema to fail loudly on impossible objects, not silently
    snap to an in-set wrong one.
  - Snapping is still applied to ``fault_object`` (canonical-form
    normalization) but is now a no-op on ``root_cause`` because the
    schema guarantees in-vocab values.

OpenAI-only feature. ``client.beta.chat.completions.parse()`` requires
``gpt-4o-2024-08-06+`` or any ``gpt-5`` model. For Anthropic / non-OpenAI
predictors, callers fall back to the default text-emit variant in
``llm_call.py``.

Why bench-only: this is the predictor that formalizes opensre's
investigation into paper-format JSON for scoring. Schema enforcement here
makes the bench number more honest (no off-vocab fallout) but is not part
of opensre's production investigation behavior. Production opensre is
untouched.

    Cost: emits ``_emit_usage`` after a successful call so the bench
