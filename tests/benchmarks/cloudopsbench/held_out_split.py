"""Held-out 20% test split for the Cloud-OpsBench corpus.

Implements integrity Mechanism 8 (generalization gate) from the framework's
Pillar 0: 20% of cases are eval-only, never inspected during BDIL
optimization cycles. The split is **derived deterministically** from the
sorted ``case_id`` list — same corpus + same seed → same split, forever.

Policy (mirrors the pre-registration YAML at
``tests/benchmarks/cloudopsbench/configs/preregistrations/cloudopsbench_v1.yml``):

  - 80% optimize-against / 20% eval-only
  - ``HELD_OUT_SEED = 42`` — distinct from ``config.seed`` (case-selection seed
    inside each run). Sharing seeds would couple "which 20% is held out" to
    "which N cases this run drew", which would silently invalidate the gate.
  - Selection is uniform random over the SORTED case_id list, not the order
    the loader returns. Sorting first guarantees stability across loader
    iteration-order changes.
  - The split is computed at adapter ``load_cases`` time and tagged on each
    ``BenchmarkCase.metadata["is_held_out"]``. Reports stratify on this.

Inspecting a held-out case's results DURING a BDIL cycle is a contamination
event — the cycle becomes invalid per the pre-registration's
``generalization_gate`` clause.
