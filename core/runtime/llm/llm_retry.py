"""Retry helper for transient LLM provider errors.

Centralises two concerns that previously lived in two places (and were
ad-hoc in others):

  1. Recognizing a "rate limit" error across providers — OpenAI, Anthropic,
     and the various wrappers opensre's clients add on top all surface
     429s with different exception classes but consistent message text.
  2. Retrying with exponential backoff when the recognizer says yes.

Why a helper instead of catching the SDK's typed exceptions everywhere:
opensre wraps provider exceptions into ``RuntimeError`` at boundaries
(see e.g. ``AnthropicAgentClient.invoke`` raising
``RuntimeError("Anthropic rate limit exceeded: ...")``). Downstream code
only sees the wrapped text — matching by text is the common denominator
without taking a hard import dependency on every provider's exception
module.

The agent LLM client (:mod:`core.runtime.llm.agent_llm_client`) uses
:func:`is_rate_limit_error` inside its own retry loop so the
investigation survives a transient 429 the same way it survives a 500.
Any code path that performs its own LLM call can wrap it with
:func:`retry_on_rate_limit` to inherit the same backoff + jitter
contract.

#      response body (``body.error.code``). Documented at
#      https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes — these codes
#      are part of OpenAI's API contract and don't change as message
#      wording is updated.
#   2. Text-substring fallback (REQUIRED for Anthropic, defensive for
#      wrapped RuntimeErrors). Anthropic does NOT expose a credit-specific
#      error type — credit-too-low lands as a generic
#      ``invalid_request_error`` (400) with the wording in the message body
#      only. See https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/errors. Text matching is
#      the only signal Anthropic gives us; reword-fragility is theirs, not
#      ours, but our tests pin the current wording so CI catches drift.
